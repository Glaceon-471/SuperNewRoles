# Features of this mod
## Controller Compatible
Controllers can be used for button use!

## Multiple people can be set up 
All crewmates can also be used as sheriffs, etc.!<br>
In SHR mode, "everyone's sheriff" is not supported due to the specification that the sheriff replaces the imposter.<br>
After the match starts, the crewmate is immediately judged the winner of the task.<br>
(No one with a task = 0 tasks left for Crew.)<br>
Please include one Crew camp position that has a task.<br>
(Adding a MadMate, JackalFriends, or Home Security Guard not help.)<br>
